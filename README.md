StarTrek
========

This is a port of the original Super StartTrek game from 1978 to F#.

The original game was written in BASIC and published in the book "BASIC Computer Games" by David H. Ahl.

The original basic source code is available https://github.com/Pooncarie/StarTrek/blob/master/StarTrek/st.bas

You can run the original game using Vintage BASIC http://www.vintage-basic.net/games.html

I am learning functional programming and F#. I thought this would be a fun project to work on. It has been an interesting and informative experience. There is no doubt code that isn't very functional or follows best practice for F#. I can only plead ignorance.

I am sure there are many ways to improve the code and I would welcome any suggestions.

There no doubt bugs in the code and from time to time I will fix them as I find them.
